Image Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on building an image classification model using TensorFlow to classify images of "happy" and "sad" faces. The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model that can generalize effectively to unseen data, ensuring robust performance across a variety of test cases.

Steps Completed
1. Setup
Installed and configured the development environment, including TensorFlow and other necessary dependencies (e.g., OpenCV, Matplotlib).
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly.

2. Data Handling
Dataset Loading:
Loaded a dataset containing labeled images of "happy" and "sad" faces.
Preprocessing:
Resized all images to a consistent shape of (256, 256, 3) for model compatibility.
Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1] for better convergence during training.
Split the dataset into:
Training Set: Used for model learning.
Validation Set: Used to monitor performance during training and prevent overfitting.
Test Set: Used for final evaluation of the model.
Exploration:
Conducted an initial analysis of the dataset to understand class distributions, visualize examples, and identify potential biases.

3. Model Development
Designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture in TensorFlow:
Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
Fully connected layers for classification.
Output layer with softmax activation for binary classification.
Configured the model with:
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer with a learning rate schedule.
Metrics: Accuracy to track performance during training.

4. Model Training
Trained the model using the training dataset.
Implemented callbacks (e.g., early stopping) to optimize training and prevent overfitting.
Plotted training and validation curves for accuracy and loss to monitor model learning over epochs.

5. Evaluation
Evaluated the model on the test set to measure its performance.
Key metrics:
Test accuracy: [Insert value, e.g., 90%].
Test loss: [Insert value, e.g., 0.2].
Observed generalization and identified areas for improvement.

6. Testing
Tested the model with unseen images to validate real-world applicability.
Observed some misclassifications, highlighting areas for potential refinement.
Identified the need for further testing with diverse and challenging examples.
